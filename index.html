            <h3>Pet Grooming</h3>
            <p>The beauty of your pet lies on the appearance of his/her skin, fur or hair (Color coat). The skin is the
              first line of defense against diseases. So a healthy skin keeps most infective diseases away. Ungroomed
              skin coat is not only ugly but is prone to wounds, because they are usually itchy. At Centre Veterinary
              Clinic, we
              offer grooming services such as hair clipping, nail clipping, ear cleaning, medical bath and shampooing.
